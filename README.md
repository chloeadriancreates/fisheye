## Presentation
*This is a fictional project, which started as project 6 of my OpenClassrooms front-end development program, made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I decided to remake it with React, Redux and Sass, using my new skills. You can visit this new version [here](https://fisheye.chloeadrian.dev/)!* \
Fisheye is a freelance photographer platform that allows photographers to display their work and get in contact with clients. Each photographer has a profile page with their details, a contact form, and their work, which can be displayed in full-screen thanks to the gallery. Clients can also like their favorite photos and videos.
